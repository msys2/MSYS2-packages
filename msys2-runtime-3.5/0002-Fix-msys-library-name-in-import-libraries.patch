Subject: [PATCH 02/N] Fix msys library name in import libraries

Cygwin's speclib doesn't handle dashes or dots. However, we are about to
rename the output file name from `cygwin1.dll` to `msys-2.0.dll`.

Let's preemptively fix up all the import libraries that would link
against `msys_2_0.dll` to correctly link against `msys-2.0.dll` instead.
