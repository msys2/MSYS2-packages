Subject: [PATCH 25/N] Add a helper to obtain a function's address in
 kernel32.dll

In particular, we are interested in the address of the CtrlRoutine
and the ExitProcess functions. Since kernel32.dll is loaded first thing,
the addresses will be the same for all processes (matching the
CPU architecture, of course).

This will help us with emulating SIGINT properly (by not sending signals
to *all* processes attached to the same Console, as
GenerateConsoleCtrlEvent() would do).

+
+This program is a helper for getting the pointers for the
+functions in kernel32 module, and optionally injects a remote
+thread that runs those functions given a pid and exit code.
+
+We use dbghelp.dll to get the pointer to kernel32!CtrlRoutine
+because it isn't exported. For that, we try to generate console
+event (Ctrl+Break) ourselves, to find the pointer, and it is
+printed if asked to, or a remote thread is injected to run the
+given function.
