Subject: [PATCH 20/N] Default to `disable_pcon`

The pseudo console support is just a bit too buggy still:

- When typing anything in an interactive Bash session before the prompt
  is shown, frequently the keystrokes are then replayed _twice_ when the
  prompt is active.

  Even worse: it seems that under certain circumstances (e.g. when
  spawning `less.exe` from a MINGW process), keystrokes are recorded
  while a process is active that wants to consume them but those
  recorded keystrokes are then replayed once the process finished (e.g.
  the `q` keystroke to exit `less.exe` will then be misinterpreted for
  interactive input in the Bash session).

- When `vim` is called from a MINGW process, it seems that the terminal
  loses the `onlcr` property after the `vim` process finished, i.e.
  subsequently printed lines do not start at the beginning of the line
  anymore, but precisely where the previous line ended.

- In `vim`, when selecting text visually (via the `v` keystroke), it
  seems that the selection is frequently reset while navigating with the
  arrow keys.

There are probably quite a few more rough edges in the pseudo console
feature, unfortunately.

In light of these issues, it makes most sense to disable the pseudo
console support and make it opt-in rather than opt-out.
