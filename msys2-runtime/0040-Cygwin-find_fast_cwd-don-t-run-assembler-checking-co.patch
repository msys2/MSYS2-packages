Subject: [PATCH 40/N] Cygwin: find_fast_cwd: don't run assembler checking
 code on ARM64

https://cygwin.com/pipermail/cygwin/2024-February/255397.html
reports a crash on ARM64 probably related to checking x86_64
code on the x86_64 emulator on AArch64.

At least for testing, pull the code checking the host HW
up to be called before trying to evaluate assembler code.

This fixes https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/issues/4808

Backported from 4e77fa9b8b (Cygwin: find_fast_cwd: don't run assembler
checking code on ARM64, 2024-02-13).
