Subject: [PATCH 21/N] popen: call /usr/bin/sh instead of /bin/sh

We mount /usr/bin to /bin, but in a chroot this is broken and we
have no /bin, so try to use the real path.

chroot is used by pacman to run install scripts when called with --root
and this broke programs in install scripts calling popen()
(install-info from texinfo for example)

There are more paths hardcoded to /bin in cygwin which might also be broken
in this scenario, so this maybe should be extended to all of them.
