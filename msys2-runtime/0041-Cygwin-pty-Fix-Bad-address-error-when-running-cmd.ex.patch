Subject: [PATCH 41/N] Cygwin: pty: Fix 'Bad address' error when running
 'cmd.exe /c dir'

- If the command executed is 'cmd.exe /c [...]', runpath in spawn.cc
  will be NULL. In this case, is_console_app(runpath) check causes
  access violation. This case also the command executed is obviously
  console app., therefore, treat it as console app to fix this issue.

  Addresses: https://github.com/msys2/msys2-runtime/issues/108

This is a backport of 08281cf4cc (Cygwin: pty: Fix 'Bad address' error
when running 'cmd.exe /c dir', 2022-10-22).

The original patch that was replaced by this commit had this additional
information that is now sadly lost in Cygwin's history:

In 2b4f986e49 (Cygwin: pty: Treat *.bat and *.cmd as a non-cygwin
console app., 2022-07-31), we introduced a bug fix that specifically
looks for a suffix of the command's file name.

However, that file name might be set to `NULL`, namely when
`null_app_name == true`, which is the case when we detected a
command-line `cmd /c [...]`.

But the commit mentioned above did not account for that possibility,
instead assuming that it always has to check the file name for a `.bat`
or `.cmd` suffix. As a consequence, `cmd /c [...]` invocations are
completely broken in v3.3.6, resulting in a `Bad address` error.
