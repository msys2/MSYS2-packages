Subject: [PATCH 15/N] path-conversion: Introduce ability to switch off
 conversion.
MIME-Version: 1.0

When calling windows native apps from MSYS2, the runtime tries to
convert commandline arguments by a specific set of rules. This idea was
inherited from the MSys/MinGW project (which is now seemingly stale, yet
must be credited with championing this useful feature, see MinGW wiki
https://web.archive.org/web/20201112005258/http://www.mingw.org/wiki/Posix_path_conversion).

If the user does not want that behavior on a big scale, e.g. inside a
Bash script, with the changes introduced in this commit, the user can
now set the the environment variable `MSYS_NO_PATHCONV` when calling
native windows commands.

This is a feature that has been introduced in Git for Windows via
https://github.com/git-for-windows/msys2-runtime/pull/11 and it predates
support for the `MSYS2_ENV_CONV_EXCL` and `MSYS2_ARG_CONV_EXCL`
environment variables in the MSYS2 runtime; Many users find the
simplicity of `MSYS_NO_PATHCONV` appealing.

So let's teach MSYS2 proper this simple trick that still allows using
the sophisticated `MSYS2_*_CONV_EXCL` facilities but also offers a
convenient catch-all "just don't convert anything" knob.
