Subject: [PATCH 12/N] dcrt0.cc (globify): Don't quote literal strings
 differently when dos_spec

Reverts 25ba8f306f3099caf8397859019e936b90510e8d. I can't figure out what
the intention was. I'm sure I'll find out soon enough when everything breaks.

This change means that input of:
  '"C:/test.exe SOME_VAR=\"literal quotes\""'

becomes:
  'C:/test.exe SOME_VAR="literal quotes"'

instead of:
  'C:/test.exe SOME_VAR=\literal quotes\'

.. which is at least consistent with the result for:
  '"no_drive_or_colon SOME_VAR=\"literal quotes\""'

The old result of course resulted in the quoted string being split into
two arguments at the space which is clearly not intended.

I *guess* backslashes in dos paths may have been the issue here?
If so I don't care since we should not use them, ever, esp. not at
the expense of sensible forward-slash-containing input.
