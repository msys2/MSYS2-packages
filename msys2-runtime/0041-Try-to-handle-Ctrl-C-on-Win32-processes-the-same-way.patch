Subject: [PATCH 41/N] Try to handle Ctrl+C on Win32 processes the same way
 CMD does

When a process is terminated via TerminateProcess(), it has no chance to
do anything in the way of cleaning up. This is particularly noticeable
when a lengthy Git for Windows process tries to update Git's index file
and leaves behind an index.lock file. Git's idea is to remove the stale
index.lock file in that case, using the signal and atexit handlers
available in Linux. But those signal handlers never run.

Note: this is not an issue for MSYS2 processes because MSYS2 emulates
Unix' signal system accurately, both for the process sending the kill
signal and the process receiving it.  Win32 processes do not have such a
signal handler, though, instead MSYS2 shuts them down via
`TerminateProcess()`.

For a while, Git for Windows tried to use a gentler method, described in
the Dr Dobb's article "A Safer Alternative to TerminateProcess()" by
Andrew Tucker (July 1, 1999),
http://www.drdobbs.com/a-safer-alternative-to-terminateprocess/184416547

Essentially, we injected a new thread into the running process that does
nothing else than running the ExitProcess() function.

However, this was still not in line with the way CMD handles Ctrl+C (it
calls GenerateConsoleCtrlEvent()) and therefore could not be handled
properly e.g. by node.js.

So now we try to handle SIGINT/SIGTERM by attaching to the console of
the command to interrupt, and generating the very same event as CMD
does.

This fixes the MSYS2 side of the bug where interrupting `git clone
https://...` would send the spawned-off `git remote-https` process into
the background instead of interrupting it, i.e. the clone would continue
and its progress would be reported mercilessly to the console window
without the user being able to do anything about it (short of firing up
the task manager and killing the appropriate task manually).

Note that this special-handling is only necessary when *MSYS2* handles
the Ctrl+C event, e.g. when interrupting a process started from within
MinTTY or any other non-cmd-based terminal emulator. If the process was
started from within `cmd.exe`'s terminal window, child processes are
already killed appropriately upon Ctrl+C.
