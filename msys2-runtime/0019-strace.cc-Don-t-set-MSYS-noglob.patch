Subject: [PATCH 19/23] strace.cc: Don't set MSYS=noglob

Commit message for this code was:

* strace.cc (create_child): Set CYGWIN=noglob when starting new process so that

  Cygwin will leave already-parsed the command line alonw."

I can see no reason for it and it badly breaks the ability to use
strace.exe to investigate calling a Cygwin program from a Windows
program, for example:
strace mingw32-make.exe
.. where mingw32-make.exe finds sh.exe and uses it as the shell.
The reason it badly breaks this use-case is because dcrt0.cc depends
on globbing to happen to parse commandlines from Windows programs;
irrespective of whether they contain any glob patterns or not.

See quoted () comment:
"This must have been run from a Windows shell, so preserve
 quotes for globify to play with later."
