# Once sourced, this script provides common information associated with the
# current MSYSTEM. For example, the compiler architecture and host type.

# The MSYSTEM_ prefix is used for avoiding too generic names. For example,
# makepkg is sensitive to the value of CARCH, so MSYSTEM_CARCH is defined
# instead. The MINGW_ prefix does not influence makepkg-mingw variables and
# is not used for the MSYS shell.
